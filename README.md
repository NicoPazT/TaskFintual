# Task Fintual

This repository contains the solution to the Fintual task.

The code was developed and tested using **Python 3.13.3** and executed from a **PowerShell terminal on Windows**.

## Technologies used

* Python 3.13.3
* Windows 10
* PowerShell
* Visual Studio Code

## Execution

1. Clone the repository and move into the project directory.

2. Run the script:

```python homework.py```

If the command above doesn't work, try:

```python3 homework.py```

## Assumptions

* The code will always receive portfolios where the sum of the percentage of their stocks is 100%.
* A more robust implementation could be added using databases to access directly to the information needed dynamically, but this is considered out of the scope for the task.
